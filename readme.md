## Web schedule management system for the Faculty of Telematics

This system makes schedule management task easier for the administration of the Faculty of Telematics.
It provides a better way to create templates of a complete schedule, add classes to certain hours, at certain classrooms with an specific teacher.
It validates every action, so it's very difficult to assign an hour twice in the same day and same classroom.
The system can generate the required reports for the human resources department of the University. This saves lots of time to the administration of the Faculty
